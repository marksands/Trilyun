Trilyun
=======

What
----

Trilyun is a satirical form of google. As both are large numbers spelled wrong. The catch is, the first 100 results are stored into a convenient CSV file available from the download page.

How
---

Even though I hate this meme:

1. Input your query
2. Specify a filename
3. Click search
4. ????
5. Profit!

Why
---

To impress a dude and some others.
